# Nano Banana Pro Guide

Google has released a practical guide for Nano Banana Pro. It explains the key mechanics of the model, provides examples of working prompts and real scenarios where the pro model performs best. These insights change the way we work with image generation.

✦ The model can think. It responds to the overall idea, not just separate words. It analyses composition, physics and context, and performs hidden reasoning before rendering. The more precisely you describe a scene, the more accurate and realistic the image will be.

✦ Real data from search. The neural network uses information from Google Search to verify facts before generation. This is useful when you need to visualize current data such as weather, events, trends, maps or a specific place. Ask the model to check data and the image will be more accurate than a usual generation where AI makes up details.

✦ Write naturally and specifically. The model works better with a human description rather than a string of keywords. It needs to understand the whole scene: character, light, atmosphere, materials and mood. The more natural and lively you describe the situation in plain language, the more meaningful the result.

✦ Define the goal. The model takes into account the task and adapts its style. If you specify that an image is for premium advertising or for educational material, the neural network will choose an appropriate style, composition and colours. Context improves quality because the model is solving a task rather than simply producing an image.

✦ Portrait similarity. The pro version can lock identity. The “Identity Locking” mechanism keeps the face stable in any scene. Emotions, angles and surroundings can change, but the features remain unchanged. To achieve this, add to your prompt: Keep the person's facial features exactly the same as Image 1.

✦ Storyboards. The neural network can maintain style, characters and mood across a series of images without breaking visual integrity. Frames stay linked by style, colour and character. You can create mini stories, storyboards and concepts, and the whole series will look like one project.

These points are derived from Google's guide. My own series of posts about prompt engineering for the pro version will continue soon.
