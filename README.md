# Nano Banana Prompts

A curated collection of prompts and experiments with Google's generative model (Gemini/Bard).

## Plush Memes Prompt

Make plush memes with Nano Banana Pro using a single prompt. This experiment turns drawn memes into photorealistic renders with plush characters. Share your version and tag me; I feature the best examples.

✦ Pick any meme and apply the prompt to transform it into a realistic scene with plush characters.<br>
✦ Publish your version and tag me; I feature the best examples.

**Prompt**

Turn this drawn meme into a photorealistic 3D render. Keep the composition, framing and layout identical, but translate all elements into realistic materials and believable lighting. Convert the main character into a plush toy version of itself, and render all environmental effects with realistic physical behaviour.
