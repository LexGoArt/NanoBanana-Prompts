# 3D Miniature Prompt

Create a 3D miniature of your favourite series with a single prompt. The model first analyses the universe of the show — locations, atmosphere, iconic objects and characters. Only then does it render the image, resulting in a miniature scene you could print on a 3D printer.

✦ Replace [SERIES NAME] with the title of the show, book, film or other fictional world.<br>
✦ Imagine a 45° top‑down isometric miniature 3D cartoon city block built entirely from the show’s recognisable architecture and settings, with each building and character figure used only once and arranged densely but clearly. Render in a 2:3 aspect ratio.<br>
✦ Render with soft physically based materials, gentle realistic lighting, clean shadows and a minimal solid‑colour background.<br>

**Prompt**

```
First, analyse the core world‑building of [SERIES NAME]: identify its iconic buildings, signature locations, atmosphere, props, character silhouettes and colour palette. Mentally plan the spatial arrangement and lighting of a 3D miniature isometric scene before rendering, ensuring the final output uses a 2:3 aspect ratio. Then create a 45° top‑down isometric miniature 3D cartoon city block built entirely from the show’s recognisable architecture and settings, with each building and each character figure used only once, with no repeats and arranged in a dense but readable layout. All buildings and character figurines must stand together on a single base‑plate platform that unifies the entire 3D miniature. Render with soft PBR materials, gentle realistic lighting, clean shadows and a minimal solid‑colour background. At the top‑centre, place the show’s title in its authentic poster‑style typography.
